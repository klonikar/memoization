memoization
===========

Javascript library to demonstrate memoization of n-argument functions. This is useful in dynamic programming. Implementation is based on closures in javascript

memoize: a general-purpose function to enable a function to use memoization
Based on: http://unscriptable.com/2009/05/01/a-better-javascript-memoizer/#more-272
Changed to handle recursive functions which the original implementation did not handle.
